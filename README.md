# ANALYZING-BEIJING-HOUSING-PRICES
The real estate market is exposed to many fluctuations in prices. The housing market in Beijing have become inflated significantly over the last decade. This research is to analyse the structural nature of the Beijing housing market, the marketâ€™s history and price levels and subsequent responses.

When looked from a macroeconomic perspective, there are many aspects that significantly effects the behaviour of the housing market, such as demographics, interest rates, gdp, inflation, government regulation and for short, global economic health and analysing the correlation between these factors to the housing prices.   

The aim is to develop a machine learning application that identifies opportunities in the real estate market in real time. The application is implemented as a regression problem that tries to estimate the market price of a house given features retrieved from online listings. For building this application, we have performed a feature engineering stage in order to discover relevant features that allows for attaining a high predictive performance. Several machine learning algorithms have been tested, including regression, gradient boost and random forest, identifying advantages and handicaps of each of them.
